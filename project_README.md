### Introduction
- The capstone project was designed to test our overall ability on full-stack web development processes. Using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) full-stack applications in building our website, as the user you should expect to interact with the application with little to no issues. Please see the How-To below.

How-To Tutorials: When entering the website you initially view a home page that carries the title of the company, Capture It Photography, and a navigation bar located at the top of the page. The navigation bar includes these options: Home, Gallery, Schedule Appointment, Photo Sale, Shopping Cart, Contact, Subscribe Here, and a company logo attached to the company name that allows the user to click and be taken directly to the companies gallery that showcases all their work. When clicked, the Home tab navigates the user back to the home page no matter where on the application the user is. The Gallery tab navigates the user to an interactive gallery of the companys work, it transitions on its own, but the user has the option of clicking on a specific photo to view at any one time. If the user wished to schedule an appointment they would click on the Schedule Appointment tab where they are then navigated to that page. The user must fill out all required information in order to submit their desired appointment. The user also has the option to purchase specific photographs listed for sale on the Photo Sale page, once on this page the user can add photos to a shopping cart, and then can proceed to said shopping cart using one of two options: the first being the button at the bottom of the sale page that says Go to Shopping Cart or the second being the Shopping Cart tab located on the navigation bar. Both ways take you directly to the shopping cart page where the user then has a number of options depending on how they wish to proceed. Once in the shopping cart page the user may add to the quantity or delete the items from their cart, there is also a continue shopping button that will direct the user back to the photo sale page, and directly above the checkout and continue shopping button is the subtotal of the cart. If the user wants to proceed with checkout they need only to click the checkout button located at the bottom of the page where they will be navigated to the checkout page. The checkout page is specifically designated for billing purposes, the user will then be instructed to enter their billing and/or shipping information and will not be allowed to proceed without entering all required information, at the bottom of the form is the subtotal, tax, and total of the users amount owed for the items. Once the information is entered the user clicks submit order to finalize checkout, and they are then directed to a final checkout page where they get a confirmation on the submission of their order along with a button that gives them the option to return back to the home page. The next tab on the navigation bar is a Contact page that entails the owners of Capture It Photographys contact information. Lastly, the Subscribe Here tab directs the user to the subscribe page where they then can enter their email, password, and a confirmation of their password in order to subscribe to the companies latest sales and information. Once all required information is submitted the user hits submit, is given a confirmation of their submission and is then directed back to the home page.
